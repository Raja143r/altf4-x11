# Alt+F4 for X11

A Linux script that mimics **Windows-style Alt+F4** behavior on X11 desktops:

- Closes the currently focused application window if any normal windows are visible.
- Shows the GNOME shutdown menu if all normal windows are minimized or closed.

---

## Features

- Works on most Linux distributions running X11 and GNOME.
- Automatically detects minimized windows.
- Lightweight Bash script using `xdotool`, `wmctrl`, and `xprop`.
- Open-source and free to use, modify, and redistribute (with credit).

---

## Requirements

Make sure the following commands are installed on your system:

- `bash`
- `xdotool`
- `wmctrl`
- `xprop`

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/altf4-x11.git
